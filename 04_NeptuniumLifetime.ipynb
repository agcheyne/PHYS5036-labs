Excited nuclei can decay, emitting $\\gamma$-rays (energetic photons), $\\alpha$-particles ($^4\\text{He}$ nuclei), $\\beta$-particles (electrons or positrons, together with an unseen neutrino) or, in some cases, by fission into two daughter nuclei of roughly comparable size.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### General Information:\n",
    "- The WD300/N MULTIPULSER MODULE (Figure 1) contains a variable delay unit. \n",
    "- Provides an electronic delay to logic pulses fed into the input. \n",
    "- Has four switchable delay ranges: 50-200ns, 0.2-2μs, 2-20μs and 20-200μs. \n",
    "- Each range is variable through a multi-turn potentiometer, but it is necessary to calibrate the setting to obtain the corresponding time delay. \n",
    "- The multipulser has a 'dual' input. \n",
    "- The unused input port must be terminated.\n",
    "- Output is via the `DELAY` port. \n",
    "- The two other unused output ports must also be terminated. \n",
    "- The multipulser is capable of providing larger delays than a switched delay box, and also has the advantage that the delayed pulse output by the unit has a standard shape (amplitude -0.8V, and a fixed pulse width 10ns) and is not degraded by attenuation or dispersion in long cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required equipment:\n",
    "- Digital oscilloscope \n",
    "- Bipolar pulse generator\n",
    "- Multipulser module located in NIM bin\n",
    "- Standard length (1m) coaxial cables with BNC plug connectors\n",
    "- A number of $50\\Omega$ terminators and T-junctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Settings:\n",
    "- Pulse generator: \n",
    "    - Period: 1µs (frequency 1MHz); \n",
    "    - Width: 20ns; \n",
    "    - Output: negative pulse 0.8V amplitude.\n",
    "- Digital oscilloscope: \n",
    "    - DC coupled; \n",
    "    - Channel 1 vertical scale 500mV/div; \n",
    "    - Channel 2 vertical scale 500mV/div; \n",

    "- All unused input and output ports of the multipulser must be terminated with $50\\Omega$ terminators.\n",
    "- You should now see two pulses on the oscilloscope, with the pulse on channel 2 occuring later than the pulse on channel 1. \n",
    "- The difference in time is due to the difference in cable lengths after the discriminator and the processing time of the multipulser unit. \n",
    "- Determine each of these delays before proceeding.\n",
    "- Switch the multipulser range to 50-200ns. \n",
    "- Set the multipulser to the minimum value 0.0.\n",
    "- Figure 7 shows the form of the scope display; use the horizontal time sweep display to determine the delay between the input and output pulse.Note this delay and the corresponding potentiometer setting.\n",
