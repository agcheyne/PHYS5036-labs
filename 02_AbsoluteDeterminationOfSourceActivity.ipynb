    "\n",
    "In this experiment the Scintillation Detector is used to detect gamma-rays emitted by a radioactive source. There are three primary processes by which the gamma-rays can interact with the scintillation material:\n",

    "Compton Scattering is the purely kinematic collision of a gamma-ray and a loosely bound electron. The energies of the gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma'}$) and the electron after the collision depend only on the initial gamma-ray energy ($E_{\\gamma}$) and the angle of deflection ($\\theta$) of the gamma ray:\n",

    "\n",
    "The amount of energy deposited in the scintillator depends on the interactions of the gamma-ray with the scintillator. The three most distinct features, observed in typical energy spectra, are:\n",
    "1. All the energy of the incident gamma-ray is absorbed by the detector. This produces the Total Energy Peak (also called the Photo Peak) in a spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The gamma-ray Compton Scatters in the scintillator, and the scattered gamma-ray escapes from the crystal without any further interaction. In this case only the energy imparted to the Compton electron is absorbed. This gives rise to a distribution of energies up to the maximum allowed electron energy. The corresponding cut-off is called the Compton Edge because it is an edge, it is less easy to define its position than the Total Energy Peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The gamma-ray may Compton Scatter outside the scintillator and the scattered gamma-ray may then enter the scintillator and interact. This gives rise to a small Backscatter Peak where the energy of the photon corresponds to a deflection of 130° to 180°. It generally has very low intensity and sits on top of the Compton distribution. Its position is even harder to define experimentally than the Compton Edge.\n",
